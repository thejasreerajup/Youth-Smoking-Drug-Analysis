# Youth Smoking & Drug Data Analysis 

## Introductin
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of youth smoking and drug usage data using Python.  
The goal is to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data through cleaning and visualization.

## Dataset 
- **File:** `youth_smoking_drug_data_10000_rows.csv`  
- Contains information related to youth smoking and drug usage.  
- Used for analysis and visualization purposes.

## Tools & Technologies Used 
- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Project development environment  

## Project Workflow 
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Handling missing values  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Visualization of patterns and trends



## Key Outcomes 
- Identified trends in youth smoking and drug usage  
- Visualized data using graphs and charts  
- Improved understanding of real-world dataset handling  

## Conclusion 
This project provided hands-on experience in performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset of youth smoking and drug usage.  
By cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizing the data, we were able to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that help understand youth behavior related to smoking and drugs.  

The project highlights the importance of proper data handling and visualization for insights and lays the foundation for future predictive modeling and interactive dashboards.  
Overall, it strengthens practical skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis projects.
